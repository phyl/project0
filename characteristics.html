            <b>Charactersitic: </b>When a female eagle meets a male and they want to mate, she flies down to earth with
            the male pursuing her and she picks a twig. She flies back into the air with the male pursuing her. Once she
            has reached a height high enough for her, she lets the twig fall to the ground and watches it as it falls.
            The male chases after the twig. The faster it falls, the faster he chases it. He has to catch it before it
            falls to the ground. He then brings it back to the female eagle. This goes on for hours, with the height
            increasing until the female eagle is assured that the male eagle has mastered the art of catching the twig
            which shows commitment. Then and only then, will she allow him to mate with her.
            <br /><b>Lesson:</b>Whether in private life or in business, one should test commitment of people intended
            for partnership.

            of the mountains where it plucks off its beak, talons and feathers and new feathers, beak and talons grow.
            After about 5 months, the eagle comes out of its hiding place
            <br /><strong>Lesson:</strong> We sometimes need to get rid of old memories, habits and other past
            traditions. Only freed from past burdens, can we take advantage of the present.

            They Build their nests on high cliffs and train their eaglets to fly.

        <div id="collapseSeven" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
          <div class="card-body">
            <b>Lesson: </b>When ready to lay eggs, the female and male eagle identify a place very high on a cliff where
            no predators can reach and the male builds a nest. He picks thorns and lays them on the crevice of the
            cliff, and then he collects twigs which he lays in the intended nest. He picks thorns laying them on top of
            the twigs then he picks soft grass to cover the thorns then he picks more thorns, lays them on the nest;
            picks some more grass to lay on top of the thorns, then finally plucks his feathers to complete the nest.
            The thorns on the outside of the nest protect it from possible intruders. Both male and female eagles
            participate in raising the eagle family. She lays the eggs and protects them; he builds the nest and hunts.
            When old enough to fly, the mother eagle throws the eaglets out of the nest. Because they are scared, they
            jump back into the nest. Next, she throws them out and then takes off the soft layers of the nest, leaving
            the thorns bare. When the scared eaglets jump into the nest, they are pricked by thorns. Shrieking and
            bleeding they jump out wondering why the mother and father who love them so much are torturing them. Next,
            mother eagle pushes them off the cliff into the air. As they shriek in fear, father eagle flies out and
            catches them up on his back before they fall and brings them back to the cliff. This goes on for sometime
            until they start flapping their wings. <br /><b>Lesson:</b> Active participation of both partners leads to
            success. Being comfortable where we are may result in us not experiencing life, not progressing and not
            learning at all. The thorns of life come to teach us that we need to grow, get out of the comfort zone and
            explore the world. We may not know it but the seemingly comfortable and safe haven may have thorns. The
            people who love us in their seemingly bad actions, have good intentions for us and do not let us languish in
            sloth but push us hard to grow and prosper.
